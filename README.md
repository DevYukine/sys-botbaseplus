# sys-botbaseplus

This is a C++ port of [olliz0r sys-botbase](https://github.com/olliz0r/sys-botbase) which is also based on [jakibakis sys-netcheat](https://github.com/jakibaki/sys-netcheat)

### Prerequisites

If you wanna run this you need a switch with cfw installed (preferably Atmosphere 0.10.2)

## Getting Started

> This was only tested on Atmosphere 0.10.2, so if you use another version or cfw your experience might vary

1. Copy the sys-botbase.nsp file to sdmc://atmosphere/contents/430000000000000B rename it to exefs.nsp
2. Create a new folder in sdmc://atmosphere/contents/430000000000000B names "flags"
3. Create a empty file called boot2.flag inside this folder
4. Restart your switch

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo
