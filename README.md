# sys-botbaseplus

This is a modified C++ port of [olliz0r sys-botbase](https://github.com/olliz0r/sys-botbase) which is also based on [jakibakis sys-netcheat](https://github.com/jakibaki/sys-netcheat) 

This sysmodule also adds optional HTTP support, which has a few advantages over raw tcp:

- HTTP is a standardized protocol with well defined uses
- Simple & Easy implementation on the client side
- Usable from mostly everywhere (e.g. Browsers, Apps, Server Applications etc.)


## Prerequisites

If you wanna run this you need a switch with cfw installed (preferably Atmosphere 0.10.2+)

## Getting Started

> This sys-module was only tested on Atmosphere 0.12.0, so if you use another version or cfw your experience might vary

1. Copy the sys-botbaseplus.nsp file to sdmc://atmosphere/contents/430000000000000C rename it to exefs.nsp
2. Create a new folder in sdmc://atmosphere/contents/430000000000000C names "flags"
3. Create a empty file called boot2.flag inside this folder
4. Restart your switch

## Contributing

### Building

1. Install gcc (needs support for C++20) & make
2. Install dependencies needed to build [Atmosphere-libs](https://github.com/Atmosphere-NX/Atmosphere/blob/master/docs/building.md)
3. Clone repo and init all submodules
4. Execute the Makefile
